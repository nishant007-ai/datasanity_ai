## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishant007-ai/datasanity_ai.git
cd datasanity_ai
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
⚠️ Make sure you have all required packages installed.
If you see ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ollama', install it via:

bash
Copy code
pip install ollama
🧠 Usage
Run the main application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The script will load your CSV file, clean the data using utils/data_cleaner.py, and save the cleaned version to the cleaned/ folder.

🚀 Features
Clean and preprocess CSV datasets automatically

Remove missing or inconsistent values

Normalize columns and formats

Save cleaned datasets for further analysis

📌 Future Improvements
Add interactive CLI for file input/output

Support Excel and JSON file formats

Add logging and error handling

Integration with AI models for data validation

If you want, I can also **add badges for Python version, build status, and “Coming Soon features”** at the top to make it more visually attractive for GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?

If you want, I can also **write a `requirements.txt` template** for this project with `ollama` and other common packages so anyone can install dependencies smoothly.  

Do you want me to do that next?
